## Summary

Focusing on the 20% of features that deliver 80% of user value helps ensure rapid adoption and high impact. Based on best practices in product management and analytics tools, the core capabilities for a natural-language pandas chatbot are: **contextual understanding**, **schema scoping**, **accurate code generation**, **safe execution**, **visualization**, **session isolation**, **interactive UI controls**, and **performance optimization**. Below, each feature is defined, its current status is noted (✔ if complete, ⚠️ if improvable), and improvement opportunities are highlighted.

---

## 1. Contextual Understanding

**Why it matters:** Context-aware chatbots retain conversational state and disambiguate user intents, boosting relevance and reducing repeated clarifications ([dialzara.com][1]).

* **Status:** ✔ Implemented via full schema injection.
* **Improvement:** Move toward dynamic context narrowing (e.g., include only columns relevant to the current query) to reduce prompt size and latency ([Medium][2]).

---

## 2. Schema Scoping & Discovery

**Why it matters:** Self-service analytics tools excel when users can quickly find and filter relevant data elements without manual schema hunting ([holistics.io][3]).

* **Status:** ✔ Core schema (60 columns) is fed each time.
* **Improvement:** Add interactive “View Schema” filtering (e.g., by keyword or data type) so analysts can scope prompts more precisely ([Datadog Monitoring][4]).

---

## 3. Accurate Code Generation

**Why it matters:** 80% of the value in AI code tools comes from reliably generating syntactically correct, logical code snippets ([ProductPlan][5]).

* **Status:** ✔ Basic pandas code via LLM is working.
* **Improvement:** Integrate multi-prompt validation or chain-of-thought techniques to catch common errors and fill gaps before execution ([arXiv][6]).

---

## 4. Safe Execution Sandbox

**Why it matters:** Secure coding practices and execution vetting prevent malicious or unintended operations, a must for enterprise adoption ([DuploCloud][7]).

* **Status:** ✔ Controlled namespace via CodeWhisperer.
* **Improvement:** Layer in AST-based whitelisting or containerized execution to further limit file and network access.

---

## 5. Visualization & Charting

**Why it matters:** Effective data storytelling requires choosing the right chart types and presenting crisp, accessible visuals ([Tableau][8]).

* **Status:** ✔ Matplotlib images → base64 → React.
* **Improvement:** Offer chart type suggestions based on the query (e.g., line vs. bar) and allow simple customization (titles, labels) via additional NL parameters.

---

## 6. Session Isolation & Memory

**Why it matters:** Enterprise-grade chat agents need per-user/session memory management to keep contexts distinct and secure ([Financial Times][9]).

* **Status:** ✔ Separate DB & LLM sessions implemented.
* **Improvement:** Introduce customizable memory lifetimes or “pin/unpin” memory features so users control what persists between sessions.

---

## 7. Interactive UI Controls

**Why it matters:** A small set of well-placed action buttons (e.g., “View Schema,” “Clear Chat,” “Export Code”) delivers 80% of UI productivity gains ([Noble Desktop][10]).

* **Status:** ✔ React toolbar with basic actions.
* **Improvement:** Add a context-sensitive quick-select (e.g., top columns used in last query) and “undo last step” functionality.

---

## 8. Performance & Scalability

**Why it matters:** Feeding large schemas into 128K-token prompts can introduce latency; optimizing delivery boosts responsiveness for 80% of typical queries ([Domo][11]).

* **Status:** ✔ Using 60 columns to fit context window.
* **Improvement:** Implement incremental loading of schema snippets or switch to a retrieval-augmented approach for truly large schemas.

By concentrating on these eight features—each representing the 20% that yields the lion’s share of user value—you’ll ensure data scientists, business analysts, and leaders alike derive rapid, reliable insights from your tool.
